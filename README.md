# Project: Hybrid Models

## Introduction

Hi there! üëã and welcome to the `Hybrid Models` project for the Ellis Summer School: AI for Earth and Climate Sciences. Please read this document carefully as it contains all the information needed for the project, but also the tutors are always available for questions and comments:

## Setup

### Applications

For this project we'll be using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), [Git and Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads), and [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/download.php), as our main dekstop applications. If you feel comfortable using any other editor, IDE or Terminal, feel free to do so.

If not, please install these before continuing.

### Package Manager

For our Python package manager we'll be using `uv`. Please follow the installation instructions for you specific platform in this [website](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) and verify that it has been installed correctly by writting the followin in your terminal:


```console
uv --version
```

### Clone this repository
Once everything is installed and working directly, clone this repository from Github. Run the following command in the directory in which you want to store your work e.g. `C:\Users\<your-username>\Projects`:

```console
git clone https://github.com/manuel-alvarez-chaves/project-hybrid-models
```

Having cloned the repository, run the command:

```console
uv sync
```

to install the required version of Python plus all required dependencies. Check the `pyproject.toml` file to take a look at the dependencies and find more information about the the workflow in the [Hy2DL](https://github.com/eduardoAcunaEspinoza/Hy2DL) library.

## Notebooks

There are two Jupyter notebooks...
